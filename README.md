# LeetCode C# Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in C#. Each problem is organized into its own folder, with a `Solution.cs` file containing the implementation and a `Program.cs` file for testing.

## About

I created this repository to track my progress in solving LeetCode problems and to improve my problem-solving skills in C#. Each solution is written in a clean and understandable manner, with comments explaining the logic where necessary.
